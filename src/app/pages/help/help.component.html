        <h2>The MAPS project is currently developing resources to support users which include (1) a glossary of terms,
          (2) 'walk through' examples of the interface options, and a case study of the interpretation of each example,
          and (3) our data analysis methods. These resources will be linked at appropriate locations in the tool, or can
          be reached via this link. </h2>
