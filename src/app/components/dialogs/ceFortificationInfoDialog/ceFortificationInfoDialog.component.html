    <h2>Average nutrient level* (mg/kg) among fortified food vehicle at point of fortification</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3><strong>What is the average nutrient level?</strong></h3>
    <p>If no additional information is available on average nutrient level at point of fortification, average level
        among percentage of fortifiable food vehicle that is fortified is assumed to be standard/target level. To
        instead adjust baseline compliance/fortification in practice based on average nutrient level among all
        fortifiable food vehicle, adjust the percent of fortifiable/industrially process food vehicle that is fortified
        with this micronutrient to 100% and change the average nutrient level (in mg/kg) among fortified food vehicle to
        the appropriate value.</p>
