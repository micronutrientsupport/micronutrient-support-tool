  <h2>Scenario Types</h2>
  <hr>
  <h3>SSP1</h3>
  <h4>Scenario SSP1 is called the Sustainability scenario</h4>
  <p>Sustainable development is realized, with relatively high levels of investment in research and development, which
    leads to rapid technological change (with a sustainable focus), decreasing inequality, lower energy intensity, and
    high land productivity. This development pathway leads to a future where society is able to relatively easily
    mitigate or adapt to climate change. There are a high rate of economic growth, declining population growth, and
    increasing levels of education globally.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>SSP2</h3>
  <h4>Scenario SSP2 is the Middle of the Road scenario</h4>
  <p>This is a middle-of-the-road scenario that follows historical trends. Economic development continues but is not
    uniform. Environmental degradation continues but at a slowing pace. There is general improvement, but it is much
    slower than that seen in SSP 1. Climate change presents moderate challenges to both adaptation and mitigation.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>SSP3</h3>
  <h4>Scenario SSP3 is the Regional Rivalry Scenario</h4>
  <p>This is a fairly negative future pathway characterized by increasing nationalism with greater levels of conflict
    and challenges to global and regional cooperation. Barriers to trade increase, and countries tend to look inward at
    the expense of global cooperation. There are lower levels of technological change. Economic development is slow, and
    population growth is higher. Climate change presents significant challenges for both adaptation and mitigation.</p>
